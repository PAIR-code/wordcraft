# ‚ú®‚úçÔ∏è Wordcraft

Wordcraft is an LLM-powered text editor with an emphasis on short story writing.

Wordcraft is a tool built by researchers at Google
[PAIR](https://pair.withgoogle.com/) for writing stories with AI. The
application is powered by LLMs such as
[PaLM](https://developers.generativeai.google/), one of the latest generation of
large language models. At its core, LLMs are simple machines ‚Äî it's trained to
predict the most likely next word given a textual prompt. But because the model
is so large and has been trained on a massive amount of text, it's able to learn
higher-level concepts. It also demonstrates a fascinating emergent capability
often referred to as
[_in-context learning_](https://huggingface.co/blog/few-shot-learning-gpt-neo-and-inference-api).
By carefully designing input prompts, the model can be instructed to perform an
incredibly wide range of tasks.

However this process (often referred to as _prompt engineering_) is finicky and
difficult even for experienced practitioners. We built Wordcraft with the goal
of exploring how far we could push this technique through a carefully crafted
user interface, and to empower writers by giving them access to these
state-of-the-art tools.

# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Build

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

# ‚òÅÔ∏è API

In order to run Wordcraft, you'll need a PaLM API key. Please follow the
instructions at
[developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/setup](https://developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/setup).
Once you have your API key, create a .env file and add the key!

```bash
touch .env
echo "PALM_API_KEY=\"<INSERT_PALM_API_KEY>\"" > .env
```

Remember, use your API keys securely. Do not share them with others, or embed
them directly in code that's exposed to the public! This application
stores/loads API keys on the client for ease of development, but these should be
removed in all production apps!

You can find more information about the PaLM 2 API at

# ü§ñ App

Wordcraft can be customized by adding additional models or adding
operations/controls. The basic architecture allows for a great deal of
flexibility in the

### `/app/context`

Defines the underlying data/examples that will be used to construct few-shot
instructions to the underlying language model. This example data can be
customized to fit a particular style or genre.

### `/app/core/operations`

Defines how the user's intent is combined with the document state, manages
updating the text editor, and handles user choices.

### `/app/models`

Defines how the data from the `Context` is combined with an `Operation` state to
construct text that will be sent to a mode, and parses model output.

## Adding new controls

To add a new custom control (e.g. a button that translates into pig latin):

- Create a new `PigLatinExamples` in `/app/context/examples`
- Create a corresponding prompt handler in `/app/models/genai/prompts`
- Register that prompt handler with the underlying `Model` class in
  `/app/models/genai/index.ts`
- Create a new `PigLatinOperation` in `/app/core/operations`
- Register the operation in `main.ts`
