    "character": "A character who is helpful and modest.",
    "target": "\"You lost, buddy?\" came a voice from behind me. Turning, I discovered a man dressed in a simple but presentable outfit. Small signs of age and loose threads hinted that these clothes, and the man himself, had seen better days."

    "character": "A character who is attractive and devious.",
    "target": "Stepping out of the alley a little too quickly, I collided with something solidly muscular and surprisingly delicately scented. \"Sorry.\" I managed, regaining my balance. \"Easy there, buddy, you're gonna hurt yourself,\" came the reply from a man with an almost feline grace, further reinforced by a stare that reminded me of a hunting cat assessing its potential prey."

    "target": "\"Excuse me. Do you know the way to the train station from here?\" I looked up from my phone to see a elderly woman in a threadbare coat, purse clutched with two hands in front of her. \"I-I'm supposed to meet my nephew there. Do... do you think you can help me?\""

    "character": "A character who is intelligent and aloof.",
    "target": "Bookish. That was my immediate reaction to this person I now saw in front of me. \"You're finally here. Did you read the notes I sent you?\" The voice sat squarely in between feminine and masculine intonation. \"No, of course you didn't.\" Dismissing my answer before I'd even formulated one. Annoyance immediately flushed through me."

    "character": "A character who is clumsy and energetic.",
    "target": "\"Whoa!\" was the only warning I had before someone slammed into my back, almost knocking me off my feet. \"I'm so sorry! WOOO! These skates are a RUSH!\" The apology came from a rather loud redhead wearing rollerblades, dark glasses and a very beefy-looking pair of headphones. That explained the volume of the apology."
